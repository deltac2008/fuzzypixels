===========
This is my first repository using git and will contain results of my coding efforts using various languages. I will also be learning the skills required to maintain code in a version controlled environment as I will be developing my code on more than one computer so a central code storage is a must.

The code I will be using will include perl, python and quite possibly ruby. It will almost certainly include sections for my developing web pages.
